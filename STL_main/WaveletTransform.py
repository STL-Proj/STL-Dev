class Wavelet_Operator:
    """
    Class whose instances correspond to a wavelet transform operator.
    The wavelet set and the operator is built during the initilization.
    The operator is applied through apply method.
    This method is DT-dependent, and actually calls independent iterations,
    but with common method and attribute structure.

    The multi-resolution is dealt with several parameters:
        dg_max, which indicates the maximum dg resolution
        j_to_dg, which indicate the dg_j resolution associated to each j scale.

    For example, if you work with J=6 wavelets and N0=256, you can have:
        - dg_max=4, with associated dg factors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
        - true downsampling factors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
        - actual resolutions (256, 128, 64, 32, 16)
        - a j_to_dg list (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3) associated to j in range(J=6)

    The wavelet convolution is DT-dependent, an is performed either in real or
    Fourier space.

    They are two main types of wavelet arrays.
        - Single_Kernel==True: In this case, a set of L oriented wavelets is
        defined at a single pixellation. Convolutions at different scales are
        then down by subsequent susampling and convolution in pixel space with
        this single set of L oriented wavelets, and convolutions at all scales
        can not be done at the initial N0 resolution.
        - SR_Kernel==False: In this case, a set of J*L dilated and rotated
        wavelets is defined at the initial N0 resolution, and a convolution at
        all scales at this initial resolution can be performed. Convolution in
        a multi-resolution scheme can also be done, where convolution at each
        scale is done at the proper downsampling factor.

    This mean that different wavelets need to be stored:
        - Single_Kernel==True: a single set of L wavelets, stored in the
        wavelet_array attribute.
        - SR_Kernel==False: a set of J*L wavelets, store both at the
        initial N0 resolution in wavelet_array, and in a multi-resolution
        framework in wavelet_array_MR.
    => The wavelet_j method then allows to call for the correct quantity when
        a convolution is performed.

    Rq: when Single_Kernel==True, j_to_dg = range(J). This is not necessarily
        the case when False.

    See apply for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    - DT : str
        Type of data (1d, 2d planar, HealPix, 3d)
    - N0 : tuple
        initial size of array (can be multiple dimensions)
    - J : int
        number of scales
    - L : int
        number of orientations
    - WType : str
        type of wavelets (e.g., "Morlet" or "Bump-Steerable")

    Attributes
    ----------
    - parent parameters (DT,N0,J,L,WType)
    - dg_max: int  (DT- and WType-dependent)
        maximum dg resolution of the Wavelet Transform
        (DT- and WType-dependent)
    - j_to_dg : list of int
        list of actual dg_j resolutions at each j scale
    - wavelet_array : torch tensor
        * array of wavelets at L orientation if Single_Kernel==True.
        * array of wavelets at J*L scales and orientation at N0 resolution
        if Single_Kernel==False
    - wavelet_array_MR : list (len J) of arrays
        list of arrays of L wavelets at all J scales and at Nj resolution
        Only if if Single_Kernel==False.
    - Single_Kernel : bool
        if convolution done at all scales with the same L oriented wavelets
    - mask_opt : bool
        If it is possible to do use masked during the convolution

    Questions and to do
    ----------
    - Is Single_Kernel sufficient in itself? We could separate the fact to do
    the convolution with a kernel in real space and to be able to do all
    convolution at the initial N0 resolution, using two different attribute.
    - We could similarly attach the fact to use mask to the fact to have
    Single_Kernel==True.
    - Do we add a low-pass filter per default for j=J ?
    - Do we impose j_to_dg = range(J) for simplicity and efficiency?
    - I propose to anyway only have dyadic wavelets for the "main set".
        -> the inclusion of P00' power spectrum terms can be done differently.
    - for __init__, we could ask either for DT and N, or for a stl_array
      instance, from which DT and N are obtained. Could be added if useful.
    - A proper "by the book" set of Wavelets should be implemented, with proper
    Littelwood-Paley and co conditions.

        Compute the Wavelet Transform (WT) of data.
        This method is DT dependent, and calls independent iterations with
        common method and attribute structure.

        Data should be a MR==False StlData instance. The wavelet transform can
        either be computed at all J*L scales and angles (fullJ), or at a given
        j scale (single_j) for all L orientations?

        For code efficiency, this method requires a MR=True StlData instance
        for the masks at all resolution, with list_dg = range(dg_max + 1).

        The different modes are:
        - fullJ (j=None and MR=False): convolution at J*L scales and angles,
            without a MR framework, only if Single_Kernel==False.
            Input data should be a MR=False StlData instance at
            dg=0 resolution. No mask are a priori allowed in this case.
        - fullJ_MR (j=None and MR=False): convolution at J*L scales and angles,
            within a MR framework, always possible.
            Input data should be a MR=True StlData instance at all
            resolution between dg=0 and dg_max [ lids_dg = range(dg_max) ]
        - single_j: at L angles at a given scale j, within a MR framework.
            Input data should be a MR=False StlData instance wtih dg = dg_j.

        Rq: If j = None, the defaut value for MR if j=None is False if
        Single_Kernel==False, and True else. For a single_j convolution, MR
        can only be true.
        Rq: mask_MR is allowed only if mask_opt==True.

        Parameters
        ----------
        - data : StlData,
            Input data of same DT/N0, can be batched on several dimension.
            -> MR=False dg=0 if fullJ
            -> MR=True list_dg=range(dg_max+1) if fullJ_MR
            -> MR=False dg=dg_j if single_j
        - MR : bool
            If convolution to be done in a MR framework.
        - j : int
            Scale at which the convolution is done. Done at all scales if None.
        - mask_MR : StlData with MR=True or None
            Multi-resolution masks, requires list_dg = range(dg_max + 1)
            mask is not allowed in fullJ mode
        - O_Fourier : bool or None
            Desired Fourier status of output.
            If None, DT-dependent default is used.

        Output
        ----------
        - WT : StlData:
            -> MR==False (..., J, L, N0) if j is None and MR==False
            -> MR==True list of (..., L, Nj) if j is None and MR==False
            -> (..., L, Nj) if j == int
            Wavelet convolutions at different scales and angles.

        Questions and to do
        ----------
        - I propose not to deal with the issue of non-periodicity here, but
        only in the mean and cov functions, at the end of the computations.
        - We could think at the possibility to compute WT at fixed (j,l)
        values, if it helps distributing the computations for large batchs.
        - To decide if we impose a condition on mask_MR, like the fact that it
        is on unit mean.
        - I'm a bit skeptical by the fact that an internal Fourier transform
        could be necessary here, since it means that the same transform could
        have to be on multiple call of this method.
        - For the convolution at a fixed scale. Should we accept data that are
        not at Nj resolution and downsample them? It need to be see with usage
